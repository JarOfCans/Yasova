# Yasova
 Yasova is a bot/program aimed at giving greater data on the Gensou Skydrift Time Attacks/Free Runs.
 After one running of the program a Settings folder will be put into <Users>/AppData/Local/Yasova/. Feel free to modify. There may also be a translation file where to put your translations
 In an effort to not overrun the skydrift servers: Please do not run this unless you know for certain you are the only one doing so.
